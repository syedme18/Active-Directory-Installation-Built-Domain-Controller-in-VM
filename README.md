# Managing Organizational Units, Users, and Computers in Active Directory

Covering the steps to create organizational units (OUs), users, computers, and how to move objects in Active Directory. Screenshots (ss) can be attached to the respective sections for clarity.

---

## 1. Creating an Organizational Unit (OU)
1. Right-click on the domain.
2. Go to **New**, and click on **Organizational Unit**. ![VirtualBox_Win server 16_16_11_2024_21_40_02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa78603-9ec6-4aff-b09d-87862d4d02b5)

3. Enter the name of the OU and click **OK**. ![VirtualBox_Win server 16_16_11_2024_21_41_35](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa0f0368-8db9-44bd-b73d-eae352632cea)


   **Note**: When the "Protect container from accidental deletion" option is marked, the OU cannot be directly deleted.

---

## 2. Creating Nested Organizational Units
- Inside the main OU, create sub-OUs:
  - **Domain Users**
  - **Domain Computers**

**Reason**: Users and Computers created directly under the domain cannot have Group Policies applied because they are containers.

---

## 3. Creating a User in Domain Users
1. Right-click on the **Domain Users** OU.
2. Click **New**, and select **User**. ![VirtualBox_Win server 16_16_11_2024_21_50_32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bb9d2ac-1cc8-4bcc-af22-f23ccbfcf1fc)

3. Enter the following details:
   - First Name
   - Initials (optional)
   - Last Name
   - Username (domain will be selected automatically if there's only one domain). ![VirtualBox_Win server 16_16_11_2024_21_53_35](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/478f8284-b10d-4b9a-8706-1b133c77b949)

4. Click **Next**, set a password, and confirm it.
5. Review the following password options:
   - **"User must change the password at next logon"**: Requires the user to change their password upon first login.
   - **"User cannot change the password"**: The user is restricted from changing the password.
   - **"Password never expires"**: Commonly used for service accounts.
   - **"Account is disabled"**: Used when creating an account for future use.
6. For this guide, leave all options unchecked. Click **Next**, and then **Finish**. ![VirtualBox_Win server 16_16_11_2024_22_06_21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f72d98a4-fd0b-4449-ab4e-d1441bc23363)

   - The user is now successfully created.

## 6. Moving Computers from Domain to an Organizational Unit
### Steps to Move Computers:
To move the computer i can directly do by right clicking on the computer  ![VirtualBox_Win server 16_17_11_2024_00_17_23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99f4a74c-94eb-4dd1-9cf5-1e4ffa98b258)
However the better way to do is first find the computer from find option, Now i have created two computers in which "COM" is common 
so here what i will do is

1. Use the **Find** option to locate the computers:
   - Select **Find** as "Computers".
   - Set the domain to `syedme.com`.
   - In the **Computer Name** field, use a wildcard search (e.g., `*COM*`):![VirtualBox_Win server 16_17_11_2024_00_27_54](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69f705a2-0610-4378-b6a4-643d4bf6aae4)
     - The asterisk (`*`) allows for partial matching, such as any name containing "COM". 

2. Click **Find**, select the desired computers, right-click, and select **Move**. 

3. Choose the target OU (e.g., `Domain Computers`) and click **OK**. ![VirtualBox_Win server 16_17_11_2024_00_29_50](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2042d137-6c31-4cda-a0b8-90b1074a00f3)



   - Verify the move:
     - Open the target OU (`Domain Computers`) and press **F5** to refresh.
     - The selected computers should now appear.

## 7. Resetting the Password in Active Directory
### Steps to Reset a User's Password:
1. Use the **Find** option to locate the user:
   - Search by **Username** for precise results since names can be redundant.![VirtualBox_Win server 16_17_11_2024_14_40_16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccdc51e3-1b86-4a04-93f7-58bc97ffcff8)


2. Right-click on the user, and select **Reset Password**.  ![VirtualBox_Win server 16_17_11_2024_14_44_02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d6fb1a-e28a-4636-9f4e-b17c045c0a76)


3. Set a new password and confirm it:
   - **Leave the "User must change the password at next logon" option unchecked** if the user will continue with the new password set by the admin.

4. If the user's account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts:
   - Check the **"Unlock the user's account"** option.
   - If the account is not locked, leave it unchecked.


5. Click **OK** to apply the new password.![VirtualBox_Win server 16_17_11_2024_14_53_52](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/486e4ecb-9dda-4a98-9a15-1cfc8c3a132f)


   - The password has now been successfully changed.
